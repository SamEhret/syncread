# Overview
A project combining both the Google Books and Goodreads accounts, so a user can log in and update both bookshelves at once. Searching is done using the Google Books api, and searching can be done without logging in to either account.

Current features include a simple search, advanced search, and authentication with Google Books which will allow access to view bookshelves as well as add and remove books from them.
